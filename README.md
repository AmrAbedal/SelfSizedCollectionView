Welcome to the SelfSizedCollectionView README!

a lot of us face many situations that require the collection view Size have to be the same size as it's content . so we need a fast method to achieve that:

1 - adding SelfSizedCollectionView file to you project .

2 - set your collectionView type to SelfSizedCollectionView in the StoryBoard .

3 - provide a height Constraints for UICollectionView in the StoryBoard and set its Priority with value less than 250
